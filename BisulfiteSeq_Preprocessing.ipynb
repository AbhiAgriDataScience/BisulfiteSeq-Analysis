    "### Bisulfite sequencing Analysis Workflow in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "##### Project overview\n",
    "- **Study:** Xmal-RRBS on breast carcinoma before and after **neoadjuvant chemotherapy**\n",
    "- **Dataset:** Series Accession: GSE202402\n",
    "- **Technology:** Xmal-RRBS (Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing)\n",
    "    - More cost effective than Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS)\n",
    "    - Captures CpG-rich regions efficiently, enabling methylation analysis with lower sequencing depth\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Study Design & Sample Selection\n",
    "  - Pre- and post-chemotherapy paired samples\n",
    "  - Focus on Partial Response (PR) cases\n",
    "    - Ensures biologically meaningful comparisons\n",
    "    - Helps identify **chemotherapy-induced epigenetic changes\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps Covered in the Workflow\n",
    "  1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing\n",
    "  * Download files\n",

    "          - Removal of low-quality bases\n",
    "          - Trimming of adapter sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Read Alignment & Remove Duplicates\n",
    "  * Align Reads to Reference Genome\n",
    "      - Tools Used: Bismark (Bowtie2- based)\n",
    "      - Process:\n",
    "          - Bisulfite conversion-aware mapping\n",
    "  * Sort Aligned SAM Files into BAM Files and Index it\n",
    "      - Tools Used: Samtools\n",
    "  * Check & Remove Duplicates \n",
    "      - Tools Used: Bismark\n",
    "      - Outputs deduplicated, sorted BAM files\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Methylation Calling \n",
    "  * Methylation extraction\n",
    "      - Tools Used: Bismark\n",
    "      - Generates reports that summarizes the methylation levels at different sites (CpG, CHH and CHG)\n",
    "      - Output results in different formats\n",
    "          * BedGraph file: Used for visualization in genome browsers\n",
    "          * Cytosine report: Shows how much of the DNA is methylated\n",
    "          * Coverage files: Shows how well each region was sequenced\n",
    "  * Running Bismark reports\n",
    "      - Run Bismark reports for each sample\n",
    "      - Create individual HTML reports\n",
    "      - Attempt to generate a summary report (FAILED)\n",
    "      - Manually create CX reports to generate a Methylation Summary report\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Visualization\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. CX Report conversion for DMR/DML Analysis\n",
    "      - Convert CX report into DSS format\n",
    "      - Groups data by chromosome and position to create methylation count tables\n",
    "      - DSS file is then used for DML/DMR analysis in R\n",
